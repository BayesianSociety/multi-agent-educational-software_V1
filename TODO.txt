1.
Implement Barbie background, and make sure the actors and the jump, move steps are alligned with the background in position and size.

2.
Paste in the Barbie background.

Correct the following:
• 1. High: Layer 2 backend/DB requirements conflict with Layer 0 “no accounts/local-only persistence” and create
     contradictory implementation paths.
     Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:6 says no accounts and local-only persistence, but Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:43,
     Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:46, and Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:51 require backend + SQLite + Docker-based test DB
     for MVP. Then Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:50 says SQLite progress only if accounts exist. This is internally
     inconsistent and can cause agents to produce incompatible architectures.
  2. Medium: Level storage is still ambiguous (“OR choose ONE”), which weakens deterministic generation.
     Prompt_4_project_brief.txt:48 allows JSON levels or SQLite levels. That unresolved branch can lead to diverging
     agent outputs and unstable validators across runs.
  3. Medium: ARCHITECTURE_PROMPTS.md is required in narrative but not included in required outputs/validators.
     The requirement exists at Prompt_4_separate_pipeline_engine_from_project_pack.txt:414, but required outputs list
     at Prompt_4_separate_pipeline_engine_from_project_pack.txt:71 and validator sections do not appear to enforce
     existence/content for that artifact. Result: requirement can be silently skipped.
  4. Low: README run command likely mismatches the hardened compatibility model in the spec.
     README.md:2 uses codex exec --full-auto --json -o ..., while the engine spec emphasizes feature detection/
     fallback around different optional flags and a minimal compatible command (codex exec --sandbox workspace-write
     -) at Prompt_4_separate_pipeline_engine_from_project_pack.txt:45 and
     Prompt_4_separate_pipeline_engine_from_project_pack.txt:55. This can cause user-facing startup failures
     depending on CLI version.
