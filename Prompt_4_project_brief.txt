# Layer 0 — Non-negotiables
- **Target platform:** Web (modern browsers)
- **Audience / age range:** 7–12
- **Safety & privacy stance:** No accounts, no PII collection, no external network calls required to play levels. Local-only persistence (e.g., localStorage).
- **Accessibility baseline:** Keyboard operable for core interactions; visible focus states; readable font sizing; avoid color-only meaning; narration text available as on-screen text.

# Layer 1 — MVP + Core learning loop
## Core learning objectives
- **Sequencing:** blocks run top-to-bottom / left-to-right in a deterministic order
- **Procedural thinking:** plan steps to reach a goal
- **Debugging:** observe step-by-step execution and adjust blocks

## Core experience / gameplay loop
- Player assembles a small program from blocks (at MVP: **Move**, **Jump**) to guide a dog to a bone.
- Player presses **Run**.
- The dog animates while the UI highlights the current block.
- If the dog fails (falls into a gap, hits obstacle, doesn’t reach bone), player edits blocks and tries again.

## MVP scope
- 10 short levels.
- Blocks:
  - **Move(1)**: move dog forward by 1 tile
  - **Jump**: leap over a single-tile gap/obstacle
  - **Run/Start**: executes block sequence
- Minimal tutorial: Level 1 teaches Move; Level 2 teaches Jump.
- Narrative: one sentence per level + small “story progression” between worlds (e.g., “Taffy is exploring the park to find treats!”).

## Non-goals
- Multiplayer
- User accounts / cloud saves
- Complex physics simulation
- Advanced Scratch features (variables, custom blocks) in MVP

## Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- Level runner executes blocks deterministically and highlights current block during execution.
- Level 1 can be solved with a small block sequence (Move/Jump/Move...) to reach the bone.
- The app stores unlocked levels locally and restores progress on refresh.
- Tests run deterministically and exit with code 0.

# Layer 2 — Architecture constraints
- **Backend REQUIRED** for MVP. The `/backend` directory MUST contain server logic.
- **Frontend framework:** Next.js (TypeScript), using the latest stable major version available at generation time. The Next.js app MUST live in `/frontend`.
- **Backend framework:** Node.js API (TypeScript) living in `/backend` (choose this path and follow it consistently).
- **Database:** SQLite is the source of truth. Local development MUST use Docker Compose (repo-root `docker-compose.yml`).
- **Data access / migrations:** Use Prisma (or explicitly choose another migration tool). If Prisma: include `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations workflow.
- **Level format:** JSON files under `/design/levels/` (one file per level) OR stored in SQLite (choose ONE; for MVP prefer JSON-on-disk unless you truly need DB-authored content).
- **Execution model:** Compile blocks into a simple internal instruction list, then interpret step-by-step deterministically.
- **Persistence:** Store user progress in SQLite ONLY if you have accounts. If no accounts, store progress locally (localStorage) and keep DB for content/admin only.
- **Testing:** must run offline and deterministically. Provide a deterministic test command in `TEST.md` and ensure it exits with code 0. Tests MUST spin up SQLite locally (docker compose) or use a deterministic test DB container.
- **Security:** No secrets committed. Provide `.env.example` and keep real secrets out of the repo.
- **Frontend-backend integration:** Since backend is REQUIRED, frontend runtime flow MUST call backend API endpoint(s); backend must not be unused.
- **Required backend endpoints (minimum):** `GET /health`, `GET /api/levels`, `GET /api/levels/:id`.
- **Run documentation:** deliver exact startup commands for frontend, backend, tests, and optional docker compose usage in project docs.


# Layer 3 — Content & UX specifics (may evolve iteratively under /design/**)
## Scratch-like editor UX
- Palette of blocks on the left, workspace in the middle, play area on the right.
- Blocks snap/connect vertically in a single sequence for MVP.
- “Run” button starts execution; “Reset” returns dog to start position.

## Level 1 (reference example: dog must reach bone)
- Narrative bubble: **“Taffy really wants that bone!”**
- Start: dog on left side of the room.
- Goal: bone on right side of the room.
- At least one obstacle in early levels:
  - Level 1: no gap; solvable with several Move blocks
  - Level 2+: introduce a gap requiring Jump

## Visual tone
- Friendly, bright, kid-safe visuals.
- Using `background.png` as a mandatory Barbie-themed background is compulsory, and all actor positioning/sizing plus Move/Jump step distances must be aligned to that background’s scale and layout.
- Simple animations: dog walks, jumps; bone sparkles on success.
